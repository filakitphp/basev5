# FilaKit Start Kit Filament 5.x and Laravel 13.x

## About FilaKit

FilaKit is a robust starter kit built on Laravel 13.x and Filament 5.x, designed to accelerate the development of modern
web applications with a ready-to-use panel structure.

## Features

- **Laravel 13.x** - The latest version of the most elegant PHP framework
- **Filament 5.x** - Powerful and flexible admin framework
- **Panel Structure** - Includes three pre-configured panels:
    - Admin Panel (`/admin`) - For authenticated users
- **Environment Configuration** - Centralized configuration through the `config/filakit.php` file

## System Requirements

- PHP 8.3 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js and PNPM

## Installation

Clone the repository
``` bash
laravel new my-app --using=filakitphp/basev5 --database=mysql
```

### Using FilaKit CLI

Or use [FilaKit CLI](https://github.com/jeffersongoncalves/filakit-cli) for a simplified setup:

```bash
filakit new my-app --kit=filakitphp/basev5
```

> Install FilaKit CLI: `composer global require jeffersongoncalves/filakit-cli`

###  Easy Installation

FilaKit can be easily installed using the following command:

```bash
php install.php
```

This command automates the installation process by:
- Installing Composer dependencies
- Setting up the environment file
- Generating application key
- Setting up the database
- Running migrations
- Installing Node.js dependencies
- Building assets
- Configuring Herd (if used)

### Manual Installation

Install JavaScript dependencies
``` bash
pnpm install
```
Install Composer dependencies
``` bash
composer install
```
Set up environment
``` bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Configure your database in the .env file

Run migrations
``` bash
php artisan migrate
```
Build frontend assets
``` bash
pnpm run build
```
Run the server
``` bash
php artisan serve
```

## Development

``` bash
# Run the development server with logs, queues and asset compilation
composer dev

# Or run each component separately
php artisan serve
php artisan queue:listen --tries=1
pnpm run dev
```

## Customization

### Panel Configuration

Panels can be customized through their respective providers:

- `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`

Alternatively, these settings are also consolidated in the `config/filakit.php` file for easier management.

### Themes and Colors

Each panel can have its own color scheme, which can be easily modified in the corresponding Provider files or in the
`filakit.php` configuration file.

### Configuration File

The `config/filakit.php` file centralizes the configuration of the starter kit, including:

- Panel routes
- Middleware for each panel
- Branding options (logo, colors)
- Authentication guards

## Resources

FilaKit includes support for:

- User management
- Tailwind CSS integration
- Database queue configuration
- Customizable panel routing and branding

## Security headers

Every panel response carries baseline security headers from [laravel-security-headers](https://github.com/jeffersongoncalves/laravel-security-headers) (the `SecurityHeaders` middleware is the first entry in each panel's `->middleware([...])`):

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy`, `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` over HTTPS outside the `local` environment (configure `trustProxies` behind a TLS-terminating proxy)
- a `Content-Security-Policy` that keeps scripts, styles, fonts, frames and form posts first-party. Filament needs `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` in `script-src`, so it is **not** an XSS defence — escape and sanitize anything user-supplied. The CSP is disabled in `local` so the Vite dev server works.

Defaults live in `config/security-headers.php`. Admins can change them at runtime in **Settings → Security headers** ([filament-security-headers](https://github.com/jeffersongoncalves/filament-security-headers)); saved values override the config, and **Reset to config** goes back. Allow any third-party origin you add (analytics, chat widgets, CDNs) in the matching directive, and try a stricter policy with report-only first.
